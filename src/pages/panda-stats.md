The giant panda is a large, black and white bear species that is native to the southern region of central China, where it prefers mountainous habitats. Prior to the human developmental activity in the animal's habitat, the giant panda could also be found in lowland areas. The giant panda relies on the bamboo plant, which makes up nearly all of its diet. Occasionally, this species may supplement its diet with rodents, carcasses left over from other animals, grasses, or roots. Pandas grow to an average length of between 4 and 6 feet and a shoulder height of 2 to 3 feet. The male is larger, typically weighing around 350 pounds, while the female weighs between 150 to 276 pounds.

This species is divided into two subspecies: the Ailuropoda melanoleuca (the typical black and white panda) and the Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis (also known as the Qinling panda). The black and white giant panda is the more common of the two subspecies and can primarily be found in the Sichuan province. The Qinling panda is less common. This subspecies is light reddish-brown and white in color and can only be found in the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi province.

## Giant Pandas In The Wild

Currently, the wild panda population is estimated at around 1,864, which represents a 17% increase over the 2003 population size (1,596).

These wild pandas can only be found in 3 provinces of China: Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. Approximately 66.8% of the wild population lives in 67 protected nature reserves, which cover a total area of 6.37 million acres. This area of protected lands is 11.3% more than the amount of protected land available in 2003. These figures mean that around 33.2% of the panda population lives outside of protected areas, which continues to pose a threat to this species.

As a result of more than 3 decades of hard work and commitment by the Chinese government, international nonprofits, and local communities, the giant panda species is no longer considered endangered. Today, it has been upgraded on the IUCN Red List vulnerable. Most experts agree that its population size and growth are sustainable. This fact combined with the increased availability of natural habitats prompted researchers and conservationists to remove this species from the endangered list. The giant panda continues to stand as a flagship species for conservation efforts all over the world.
