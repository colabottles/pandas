Giant pandas are bears that are native to China, where they are considered a national treasure. Despite their exalted status, giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) populations are vulnerable: fewer than 1,900 live in the wild, according to the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda">Smithsonian National Zoo</a>. About 300 live in zoos around the world.
